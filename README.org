  Org Street is an extension for Org Mode for turning the names of
  places into a =LOCATION= property containing their address.  Given
  some freeform text approximately describing a location, it geocodes
  it with OpenStreetMapâ€™s Nominatum API to determine a canonical
  location.  If Nominatum returns multiple locations, a list is
  displayed to choose from.

  Having a =LOCATION= is helpful; if you export your Org Agenda to
  iCal files, the location becomes the address of the calendar entry.
